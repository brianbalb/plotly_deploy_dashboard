# Project Overview

As requested by client Roza, the objective is to create an interative dashboard dirplaying demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer in her study. 
Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons, for the purpose of Improbable Beef identifying a species for an alternative synthetic beef. Roza’s volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

Target Objectives

1. Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
2. Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
3. Complete the demographic information panel
